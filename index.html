                <p>Between an abundance of space and population centers that developed after the widespread adoption of cars, 
                    many cities in the United States are designed to move cars, not people.
                </p>
                <p>Drivers, which in the US includes the vast majority of adults, don't automatically realize how beneficial
                    bicycle and pedestrian accomodations are to streamlining automobile traffic.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>As bike and foot traffic increases, car traffic decreases</li>
                    <li>As bike and pedestrian traffic increases, the space needed to accomodate more people actually DECREASES</li>
                    <li>With fewer cars on the road, traffic flows more smoothly</li>
                    <li>For drivers, traffic time and congestion actually decreases</li>
                    <li>With designated bike and pedestrian facilities, there's no more guess-work for drivers to know where road users will be and how they will use the space</li>
                    <li>The roadway itself makes it clear who, what, and how people will be moving in public space.</li>
                    <li>Drivers will have a lower risk of collision with bicycle riders and pedestrians. People outside of cars will have safer networks to use.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Let the positive CYCLE of moving more people begin!</p>
